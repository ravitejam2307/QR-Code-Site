<b><h3 style="color:blue;">What is a QR Code?</h3></b>

<p>A QR code is a two-dimensional code (2D code, matrix code), this means it contains data not only in one dimension but also in a second dimension (vertical and horizontal). The acronym QR is short for Quick Response.<br /></p>

<p>QR codes are also often called 2D barcodes. However, this notation is not correct, because it means a two-dimensional code consisting of bars although a QR code consists of pixels instead of bars.<br /></p>

<p>The QR code was invented by the automotive industry. Toyota asked their supplier Denso Wave to develop a barcode to safely and easily identify components. QR generators were originally used in industrial applications. Therefore, they had to be easily printable in form and size as well as staying legible when partially destroyed or dirty.<br /></p>

<p>Like other codes, the QR code symbol can be captured with imaging devices like a camera and then digitally processed. A software prepares the captured image data until it can be algorithmically processed according to the QR code standard so the QR code content can be read. This process is assisted by the use of the Reed-Solomon error correction which is also used for audio CDs to ensure that the data can still be read correctly even with small scratches on the surface.<br /></p>

<p>The error correction capabilities are also used for QR codes with logo (often also called Design QR code or simply QR code with image / icon / logo). This QR code graphics are faulty ex works as the normally centered placed logo in a QR code hides some of its data just as would ordinary dirt.<br /></p>

<p>Because of the excellent error correction (they can be read even if up to 30 % of the surface gets destroyed) and the high memory capacity (in comparison with other bar codes), the QR code also gained traction outside the automotive industry. Modern mobile phones are powerful enough to run QR code reading software and also usually provide a camera. This combination brought up a variety of possibilities to use the QR code to easily transfer data without typing to the peoples new communication center, the smartphone. Therefore, a widespread use of QR codes became possible with the recent smartphone boom and the increasing spread of mobile internet.<br /></p>

<h3 style="color:blue;"><b>What is QR Code generator?</b></h3>
<p>A QR code generator is a software which stores data into a QR code. QR generator just create a QR code by typing in your data and download it as high resolution PNG or vector graphic (SVG, EPS). Now you may print your free QR code or embed it on your website to make it available to others.<br /></p>
<h3 style="color:blue;">How To Scan QR Codes With QR Stuff?</h3>
<p>Once you see a QR code whether as payment gateways, tourist information, videos, or any other QR code type use your device camera to capture the QR code. Simply point the camera at the QR code to be scanned and you're done. The first time you scan a QR code with us you be asked to give our QR code scanner permission to access the camera on your device, but after that, it's straight down to business every time.</p>
<h3 style="color:blue;">Create a QR code</h3>
<p>Just enter your text, your URL, a SMS or vCard contact information. The QR code will be generated automatically as you type. Just click on the Download button to get the created QR code image then (the image is available as EPS or SVG vector graphic, as well as high resolution PNG, GIF or JPEG raster graphics format). You can also embed the QR code directly on your own website and use it, just have a look at the code offered by the Embed button. Of course, you can place and use the QR graphic on leaflets, posters, business cards or other products without any costs / for free (including commercial use).</p>
<p>QR codes are the way to go to create a link between the real world products (tagged with the QR code) and the Internet. Mobile, anywhere, anytime. Because QR codes make it so easy to transfer a web link to a mobile phone, they provide a significantly lower barrier to visit a site with a smart phone. But you can also work with other texts and data, such as advertising messages, telephone numbers and even entire business cards in vCard format. Just encode them with our QR code generator to easily transfer the data to mobile devices.</p>
<h3 style="color:blue;">Endless lifetime with unlimited scans</h3>
<p>QRCode Monkey also has no limitations. All generated QR codes will work forever, do not expire and have no scanning limits like you see at other commercial QR code generators. The created QR codes are static so the only limitation is that you can't edit the QR code again.</p>
<h3 style="color:blue;">Custom Design and Colors</h3>
<p>Make your QR code look really unique with our design and color options. You can customize the shape and form of the corner elements and the body of the QR code. You can also set your own colors for all QR code elements. Add a gradient color to the QR code body and make it really stand out. Attractive QR codes can increase the amount of scans.</p>
<h3 style="color:blue;">QR Code Vector Formats</h3>
<p>Most free QR code makers only allow creating QR codes in low resolutions and do not offer vector formats. Use the offered vector formats to print QR Codes in huge resolutions without losing quality. We recommend the .svg format for further editing. The offered .pdf and .eps formats only support classic QR codes without the design and logo options.</p>
<h3 style="color:blue;">Free for commercial usage</h3>
<p>All generated QR Codes are 100% free and can be used for whatever you want. This includes all commercial purposes.</p>
<h3 style="color:blue;">Customizations</h3>
<p>QR Codes can be customized and thus make it possible for brands to incorporate their visual identity into their QR Codes.<br />
When customizing, some rules must be followed about the structure of QR Codes so that they remain readable. But customizing still remains a very effective way to promote your brand visual identity.</p>

<h3 style="color:blue;"><b>Are QR codes legally protected What is the licensing policy?</b></h3>
<p>The QR code developer Denso Wave patented the QR code technology and released the QR specification as an ISO standard (ISO/IEC 18004:2000 and ISO/IEC 18004:2006. However, the patent owners decided not to exercise the rights resulting therefrom. Therefore the use of the QR code technology as defined by the ISO and JIS (Japanese Industrial Standards) is free of charge. Also a usage registration is not necessary.<br /></p>

<p>The name QR code is a registered trademark of Denso Wave Inc. in several jurisdictions (including Japan, the U.S. and many European countries). An appropriate notice should be visible when using the brand, is however not necessary if the QR code is only used as a pattern / picture / graphic / logo / icon (e.g. by including it on a website or when printed on a business card, brochure, leaflet etc.).<br /></p>

<h3 style="color:blue;"><b>How to read / scan a QR code?</b></h3>
<p>A barcode scanner (or a mobile phone with camera and an appropriate reader app) which supports the QR code standard is required to scan a QR code. QR code reader apps are made available by different manufacturers and for different mobile devices, mostly for free.<br /></p>

<p>There are many free QR code reader for Smartphones. However, they differ significantly in terms of usability, scanning speed and standards compliance (in particular regarding the processing of vCards). Therefore we provide an overview about recommendable QR code software.<br /></p>

<h3 style="color:blue;"><b>How long are QR codes valid? Do QR codes expire?</b></h3>
<p>From a technical perspective QR codes do not expire or get invalid: The information a QR code offers after scanning is stored in the graphic itself (hence QR codes also get larger and form a more complex pattern if there is more data to store). The stored data cannot be changed and therefore a QR code does not (expire) after a certain time. Unfortunately, there are shady QR code providers and generators, who simply do not store the data entered by the user into the QR code. <br />An example: When you type the web address http://www.example.com, these unscrupulous providers store a redirection address like http://[domain-of-the-provider]/www.example.com into the code without notifying the user about it. So after scanning the code, you™re sent to http://[domain-of-the-provider]/ and redirected to the real destination www.example.com afterwards. The business model of these QR providers normally is to switch off the redirection after a short time frame. So the QR code (expires) even though neither the QR code symbol nor the data it provides were changed. The redirection normally is reactivated after some payment. Sadly, many users are willing to pay because re-printing publicity material, leaflets and things like that often costs more. However, there is nothing bad about QR code redirects in general (in fact, even our dynamic QR codes are based on redirects to make it possible to change the target URL after printing). But we think its bad manners to offer a (free) QR service but actually rely on the lack of knowledge of the customer to take the generated QR codes as (hostage) because the user created QR codes with expiration date without even noticing it.</p>
