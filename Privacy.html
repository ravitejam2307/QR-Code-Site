<b><h1 style="color:black;">Privacy</h1></b>
<p>Thank you for using the-qrcode-generator. Here we describe what information we collect, why we collect it and how we handle it.</p>

<b><h2 style="color:blue;">Information</h2></b>

<p>Usage information. When you use our services, we may automatically collect and store information in logs. This may include details how you use our services, your IP address, system type or settings</p>

<p>Google Analytics. We measure visitors to our website using Google Analytics. This records what pages you view within our site, how you arrived at our site and some basic information about your computer. All of that information is anonymous. So we don’t know who you are, just that somebody visited our site. The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what parts of our sites are doing well, how people arrive at our site and so on. Like most websites, we use this information to make our website better. Please see here how Google uses data. You can also opt out if you wish.</p>

<b>Static QR Codes.</b> 
<p>Static QR codes you create with our Service directly encode all content directly in the image itself. We do not collect, transmit or store any information you enter. The Code is generated directly in the browser without transmiting any information to a remote system (that's why it also works offline by the way).</p>

<b>Dynamic QR Codes.</b>
<p>Dynamic QR codes you create with our Service encode a static URL that points to the actual content (for example the actual URL) hosted by our Services. We store the content of your QR Codes on our Servers to deliver this Service.</p>

<p>Scanning QR Codes. We do not collect, transmit or store any data from QR Codes you scan using our Services. Scanning happens completely locally in your browser.</p>

<b><h2 style="color:blue;">Children’s Privacy</h2></b>
<p>Our Services are not intended for and may not be used by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 and we do not target our Services to children under the age of 13.</p>

<p>Educators that have the authority to act on parent’s behalf, may allow students under 13 to use our Services, if such use is for educational purposes, and if this use ensures that students will not provide any personal information.</p>
