<h3><p>A QR code is a two-dimensional code (2D code, matrix code), this means it contains data not only in one dimension but also in a second dimension (vertical and horizontal). The acronym QR is short for Quick Response.</p>

<p>QR codes are also often called 2D barcodes. However, this notation is not correct, because it means a two-dimensional code consisting of bars although a QR code consists of pixels instead of bars.</p>

<p>The QR code was invented by the automotive industry. Toyota asked their supplier Denso Wave to develop a barcode to safely and easily identify components. QR generators were originally used in industrial applications. Therefore, they had to be easily printable in form and size as well as staying legible when partially destroyed or dirty.</p>

<p>Like other codes, the QR code symbol can be captured with imaging devices like a camera and then digitally processed. A software prepares the captured image data until it can be algorithmically processed according to the QR code standard so the QR code content can be read. This process is assisted by the use of the Reed-Solomon error correction which is also used for audio CDs to ensure that the data can still be read correctly even with small scratches on the surface.</p>

<p>The error correction capabilities are also used for QR codes with logo (often also called Design QR code or simply QR code with image / icon / logo). This QR code graphics are faulty ex works as the normally centered placed logo in a QR code hides some of its data just as would ordinary dirt.</p>

<p>Because of the excellent error correction (they can be read even if up to 30 % of the surface gets destroyed) and the high memory capacity (in comparison with other bar codes), the QR code also gained traction outside the automotive industry. Modern mobile phones are powerful enough to run QR code reading software and also usually provide a camera. This combination brought up a variety of possibilities to use the QR code to easily transfer data without typing to the peoples new communication center, the smartphone. Therefore, a widespread use of QR codes became possible with the recent smartphone boom and the increasing spread of mobile internet.</p></h3>
