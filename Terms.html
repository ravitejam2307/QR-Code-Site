<b><h1 style="color:black;">Terms of Services</h1></b>
<p>Thank you for using the-qrcode-generator. These terms of service (Terms) cover your use and access of our website, our Chrome Extension and related software (our Services).</p><br />
<p>By using our Services you agree these Terms and to review our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms or our Privacy Policy, you should not use our Services.</p>

<h2 style="color:blue;"><b>Software</b></h2>
<p>Our Services may include web-based or downloadable software, which may update automatically on your device to newer versions. We grant you a worldwide, non-exclusive and non-transferable to use the software solely to use the Services.</p> <p>Components of the software may be offered under an open source license, in this case we will make that license available to you. Provisions of the open source license may expressly override some of these Terms.</p>

<h2 style="color:blue;"><b>Changes to Services</b></h2>
<p>We may change the features of our Services, withdraw or add new features form time to time.</p>

<h2 style="color:blue;"><b>Pricing</b></h2>
<p>Our Services are offered for free. We fund this by ads that are shown solely on the generator website. We will never show any advertisement to users that scan your QR Codes.</p>

<p>No scan limits and we'll play nice. We do not limit the number of scans of your dynamic QR Codes, nor will we ever ask you to pay to keep your Dynamic QR Codes accessible. We'll also never try to charge you for using your Services retrospectively in any other way (which should go without saying). Note that static QR Codes are completely stand-alone, without any reference or dependency on our Service. That's because they encode any content directly. So technically they are completely indpendent from us, once created.</p>

<p>Shutdown policy. If we should ever have to close this Service in the future, we'll give prominent notice on this site at least 3 years before any dynamic QR Code becomes invalid.</p>

<h2 style="color:blue;"><b>Warranties</b></h2>
<p>We strive to provide good Services and hope you enjoy using them. But there are things we cannot guarantee. We provide our Services "As is". To the fullest extend permitted by law, we make no warranties either implied or expressed about the Services. We do not make any promise about the specific functions of the services, their reliability or availability.</p>

<h2 style="color:blue;"><b>Changes to Terms</b></h2>
<p>We reserve the right these Terms at any time. We will always post the most current version on our website. By continuing to use the Services after the changes become effective, you agree to the revised Terms.</p>
